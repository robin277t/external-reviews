#External Process Review Training Sessions

This Repo contains the code from the external review sessions undertaken as part of the Makers Academy program, to train on development processes under pressure.

They are ~40 minute sessions presented live to a reviewer;
- Begin with a brief from the 'client'
- Interrogate requirements of program
- Design an input-output testing/development regime
- TDD (test driven development) to produce program
- Use Github to track progress and changes
